## Curated MCP security picks

Common “short list” curations often cluster **Arcade-style tool auth**, **A2A + MCP composition**, **packaging/catalog security (e.g. Docker toolkit)**, **community vetting workflows**, **practitioner threat framing**, and **OAuth/zero-trust talks**. The rows below mirror those picks on YouTube where a stable watch URL exists. **Nick Taylor (Pomerium)** sessions are linked under the table because many curators point at conference pages or recap posts rather than a single canonical YouTube upload.

Valuable when curators label the clip as “A2A/MCP threats/surface” in the sense of **cross-protocol composition and trust propagation**, not only single-server MCP bugs.                              |
| [The last MCP server you'll ever need...][link_youtube_com_watch_47]: **Better Stack**                                 | 2025-06-07  | Better Stack walkthrough of **Docker MCP Toolkit**-style packaging: cataloging, OAuth-forward setup, container isolation-often cited in “fix MCP sprawl/secret soup” curations.                                                                                                                    |

Often appears next to Arcade/Stytch-style “auth for agents” content as a **framework-agnostic implementation** reference.                                                                                 |

**Pomerium + Nick Taylor (talk pages / recordings).** Several lists cite Nick Taylor’s **MCP Developers Summit EU 2025** and related **OAuth + zero trust** talks rather than one long-lived YouTube mirror. Primary entry points:

- [Secure from Day One: Building Production Ready MCP Servers](https://www.nickyt.co/talks/mcp-developers-summit-eu-2025-building-secure-mcp-servers/) — OAuth 2.1 hardening, Pomerium as identity-aware proxy, unscoped tools (MCP Developers Summit EU, 2025-10-02).
- [Securing MCP Servers with Zero Trust](https://www.nickyt.co/talks/securing-mcp-servers-with-zero-trust-apollo-mcp-server-builder-series-2024/) — policy-at-the-edge framing for MCP servers exposed to agent clients.
- [Agentic Access: OAuth Gets You In, Zero Trust Keeps You Safe](https://www.nickyt.co/talks/agentic-access-oauth-gets-you-in-zero-trust-keeps-you-safe-all-things-open-2025/) — companion talk emphasizing authorization after OAuth success.
- Product context: [MCP Apps Are Here. Is Yours Secure on Day One?](https://fixel.pomerium.com/blog/mcp-apps-are-here-is-yours-secure-on-day-one) (Pomerium) and [Protect an MCP Server](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/capabilities/mcp/protect-mcp-server) (docs).

**Overlap note (API keys / client compromise).** [MCP Security is Still Broken][link_youtube_com_watch_19] (**Prompt Engineering**, 2025-04-11) and Maciej Pulikowski’s written deep-dive [Model Context Protocol (MCP) Security - Real Risks for LLM Apps (2025)](https://pulik.dev/blog/mcp-security) (2025-04-27) both stress **malicious servers instructing models toward secrets and unsafe automation**—same theme, different mediums. Keep **both** in rotation: the video for narrative pacing, the blog for reproducible examples and statistics (see also the dated mirror table in `mcp_blogs_whitepapers_academicpapers.md`).
