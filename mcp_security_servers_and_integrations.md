## Trust markets, reputation, and agent infrastructure

These projects often combine **identity, scoring, payments (for example x402)**, and **MCP** for agent-to-agent commerce. They are relevant where teams assess **third-party MCP risk** or **automated trust signals**—not a substitute for code review and policy gates.
